Hello! 

This program creates a list of isbns and then uses those isbns to find the respective pages on amazon.
From there, the page is scraped to find the 'used price' of the third party marketplace, as well as the 
'sell back price' offered by Amazon itself.  If the used price + shipping is lower than the sellback price,
it will record the information on a separate text file.  It will also send a quick email with the isbn number
in the body text (still a work in progress).  From there I decide whether it's worthwhile to buy, and then
let the money roll in! 

Thanks for looking it over.  Any suggestions are welcome!
